The CZ Patch Library (CZPL) is an essential companion for the Casio CZ series of synthesizers.  It contains:

* 2,186 presets.  Brasses, basses, pads, leads, percussion, drums, it's all in there.  
* 10,000 memory slots to store the patches you create on the CZ!  No longer are you limited to saving only 16 or 32 patches.
* 1,000 memory slots to store entire banks of patches.  Save and recall the entire memory of your synthesizer at once!  Perfect for live performance or building your own custom soundsets.
* An arpeggiator with features from the Roland Jupiter-4 and Korg microKORG arpeggiators.  The Casio CZ series comes to life when you add an arpeggiator.  Latch, keysplit, external and internal trigger.

## How do I connect it?

Connect the CZPL to your Casio CZ-101, CZ-1000, CZ-3000, CZ-5000, CZ-1 or CZ-230S synthesizer with 2 MIDI cables and power the CZPL via USB or a 9V power adapter (center positive).  

You can then connect external gear to the CZPL and all MIDI messages will be passed through to the Casio.  This lets you use sequencers and external controllers without having to unplug and plug cables.
