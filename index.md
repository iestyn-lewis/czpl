## What is it?

The CZ/PL patch library offers thousands of preloaded patches for many brands of synthesizers. It also allows you to save patches and banks that you have created on your favorite synthesizer. No more tracking down expensive RAM catridges or having to resort to a computer. Lastly, it features a very nice arpeggiator.

It works especially nicely with the Casio CZ series of synthesizers, for which it was originally designed.

## How do I connect it?

Connect the CZPL to your Casio CZ-101, CZ-1000, CZ-3000, CZ-5000, CZ-1 or CZ-230S synthesizer with 2 MIDI cables and power the CZPL via USB or a 9V power adapter (center positive).  

You can then connect external gear to the CZPL and all MIDI messages will be passed through to the Casio.  This lets you use sequencers and external controllers without having to unplug and plug cables.
